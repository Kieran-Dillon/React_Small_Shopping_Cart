# React_Small_Shopping_Cart

Project done with:"React Shopping Cart For Absolute Beginners [2022]" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmIdY1Eb8tY (Coding with Basir Youtube tutorial).

Will need to dowload files, type 'npx create-react-app app-name' in terminal, transfer files into new react app folders, then 'npm start' in terminal.

The one thing that needs improvement right away is to update cartItems number badge when you add multiple items from same product category, I will work on this and refactor the code when possible.
